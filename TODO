multi var decl:
  var i = 1, p = 2;

ambiguity:
 {} -> is it an empty object or a function?

unary operations.

types? just contracts or should we infer what we can statically?

annotations?
 I really like python annotations, and would like to implement them.

yield?
  Is it even possible?
  
  i.e. 
  var gen = { 
    var i = 0;
    while(true) {
      yield i++;
    }
  }
  becomes:
  var gen = function() {
    var i = 0;
    return {
      next: function() {
        return i++;
      }
    }
  }
